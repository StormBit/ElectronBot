# ElectronBot
Custom IRC bot written in uh... PHP. Yeah. Really.

Basically the goal is a replacement for all the offered features of the chanbot in #stormbit on irc.stormbit.net. 

Supybot really isn't the best for "just drop it in and go" operation, since most of the plugins need user registration. Lame.
